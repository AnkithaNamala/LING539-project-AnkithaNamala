- Collect code-switched text from real-world source.
- Preprocess informal multilingual text.
- Train a Skip-Gram word2vec model using Genism.
- Visualise and interpret word embeddings.

As a native Telugu speaking individual, I chose this mixed language because:
- It is underrepresented in NLP tutorials.
- It shows how models behave on real, messy multilingual text.
- It builds awareness of regional language NLP challenges.
